## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our meeting assistant application seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **security@[your-domain].com** (replace with your actual security contact)

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days, we will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability
3. **Updates**: We will keep you informed about the progress of addressing the vulnerability
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days, and other vulnerabilities within 90 days
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to address the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
